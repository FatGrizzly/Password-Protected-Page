# Password-Protected-Page
A simple, easy to make password protected page.

The auth.php file is where the user will be redirected to if they have not entered the password during the session or have just logged out.
The protectedpage.php is where you hide all the stuff you dont want everyone to see.

If you have the auth.php and the protectedpage.php if different directories, make sure to update the header() in both files to otherwise it will not automatically redirect.
